OpenSCAD Gear Library with Customizer by eleotlecram on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4194148

Summary:
This is a remix of Jörg Janssen's "OpenSCAD Getriebe Bibliothek" (OpenSCAD Gear Library).(For instructions on how to use this thing, see bottom of this page.)Supported are:RackSpur gear¹Herringbone gear¹Rack and pinion¹Annular/Internal spur gearAnnular/Internal herrinbone gearPlanetary gearBevel gearBevel gears (meshing pinion and idler)Herringbone bevel gearHerringbone bevel gears (meshing pinion and idler)WormWorm drive (meshing worm and worm gear)¹ With optional gear hubChanges:I have added English customizer variables for all the gears.Grouped parameters per gear typeAdded customizable hub option for spur and herringbone gearsTodo:Add an option for double gears.Add an option for a spur gear drive (two meshing spur gears).Add an option for gear box generation.I like the library as it is, but the perfectionist in me wants to add a proper trochoidal section to the gear tooth profiles. ... Well maybe some day.Instructions:Since not everybody seems to understand what this thing is and how to use it, here are some minimal instructions:Download the latest version of https://www.openscad.org/ (Supports Windows, Mac, Linux). (If you are on Linux, you must still download the latest version from that site; do not use the version that comes with your OS as those versions are generally outdated and unusable.)Open .scad file in downloaded version; should automatically show customizer. Otherwise, View-&gt;Hide Customizer (make sure the checkbox is unticked). If you do not see the customizer and do not see the option, go to step 1.Note:This thing might or might not work (properly) in Thingiverse customizer. I have no intention to support it. Please use OpenSCAD (see above).
